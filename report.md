## Description of the Problem

A large company manufacturing automobiles produces trucks, small cars,
and midsized luxury cars. One plant close to Detroit, MI, assembles two
models of midsized luxury cars. The first model, the Family Adventurer, is
a four-door sedan with vinyl seats, plastic interior, standard features, and
excellent gas mileage. It is marketed as a smart buy for middle-class fami-
lies with tight budgets, and each Family Adventurer sold generates a modest
profit of 3,700 for the company. The second model, the Classic Transporter,
is a two-door luxury sedan with leather seats, wooden interior, custom fea-
tures, and navigational capabilities. It is marketed as a privilege of affluence
for upper-middle class families, and each Classic Transporter sold generates
a profit of $5,300 for the company.
